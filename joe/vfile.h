/* Additions:
 *
 * Should we remove size checking from rc()?  Would make it faster...
 *
 * Should be able to open more than one stream on a file so that vseek
 * doesn't have to get called so much when more than one user is involved
 *
 * Also should have dupopen call to make more streams for a file
 *
 * Make vputs faster
 *
 * Should have a version which will use memory mapped files, if they exist
 * in the os.
 *
 * Would be nice if we could transparently open non-file streams and pipes.
 * Should there be an buffering option for that?  So we can seek on pipes to
 * get previously read data?

 * address multiples of PGSIZE).
 *
 * The page containing the data is locked in memory (so that it won't be
 * freed or used for something else) until 'vunlock' is used.
 *
 * Warning:  If you allocate more than one page and use (change) them out of
 * order, vflsh will screw up if writing past the end of a file is illegal
 * in the host filesystem.
 *
 * Also:  This function does not allocate space to the file.  Use valloc()
 * for that.  You can vlock() pages past the allocated size of the file, but
 * be careful when you do this (you normally shouldn't- the only time you
 * ever might want to is to implement your own version of valloc()).
